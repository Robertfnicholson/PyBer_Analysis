# PyBer Challenge
## Overview of Project
###Original Project
In this project, I worked as a data analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company. 
My assignment was to perform an exploratory analysis on data in some very large CSV files. To 
aid in the process, I created several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the 
data. I wrote Python scripts using Panda’s libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, 
Python’s two-dimensional plotting library, to create a variety of charts that showcase the 
relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the 
percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations that 
I created helped PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for 
underserved neighborhoods. Omar, my supervisor at PyBer, provided a series of practices for 
me to learn the Matplotlib library. This included creating line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, 
bubble charts, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots, and making them visually compelling and 
informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors. Omar also introduced me 
to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific 
computing in Python. I used Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy to perform summary statistics. </p>

### Revision of the Project
V. Isualize, the CEO of PyBer, gave Omar and me a brand-new assignment. Using my Python 
skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city 
type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total 
weekly fares for each city type. This allows our audience to absorb this information quickly and 
detect patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers in the data. Our visualizations and findings 
can be shared across teams to help project planning and drive decisions. Finally, I prepared this 
written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can 
be used by decision-makers at PyBer. </p>

## Challenges
Throughput working on Omar’s practice series on the Matplotlib library, I found the Python 
code did not compile. Like the PyCitySchools project, sometimes finding the code errors was 
simple, such as just running the entire code from the beginning rather than just the cell. 
However, sometimes it was much more challenging to find the error. In some of these 
situations, I referred to another analyst who had previously worked on a similar assignment, 
WANGHEN21, “Pyber_challenge.ipynb.” In others I used PyCharm to solve the coding error.</p>
